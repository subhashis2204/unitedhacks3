### *Your Companion for Healthy Screen Time!*

## 🚀 Introduction  
Welcome to **Critter Break**, an extension designed to encourage healthy screen habits by gamifying your break times! Whether you're working long hours on a project or binge-watching your favorite shows, our cute critters are here to remind you to take a breather. Let's turn those necessary breaks into fun moments! 🌟

## 🌟 Key Features  
1. **⏰ Automatic "Work" and "Break" Timers**: Once you start the addon, it will cycle between "work" and "break" periods, with helpful captions reminding you when it's time to rest. 
2. **🐾 Adorable Critter Animations**: During breaks, summon a critter who interacts with your cursor! This helps track whether you're taking a break by staying in the window.
3. **🌓 Screen Dimming**: When you hover your cursor over the break window, the screen dims, encouraging you to take a proper break away from your screen.
4. **🎯 Point System & Unlockable Critters**: Earn points for every minute of break time and unlock new critters! The more breaks you take, the more adorable companions you'll collect.
5. **⚙️ Customizable Settings**: Adjust your break durations, intervals, and screen dimming preferences. Your settings will sync across devices for a seamless experience.

Critter Break has been packed with robust technology to ensure it works smoothly and effectively across platforms:

## 🎨 The Concept Behind the Addon  
### Problem  
Research shows that extended screen time leads to various health risks, including:
- **Eye Strain**
- **Sleep Deprivation**
- **Sedentary Lifestyle Risks**: Obesity, cardiovascular diseases, etc.

### Existing Solutions  
Many existing browser extensions offer break timers, but most lack extrinsic motivation, making it easy to ignore or skip breaks. That's where Critter Break comes in with **gamification**—keeping breaks fun and rewarding.

### Our Solution  
I aimed for a **cross-platform browser addon**, which can run seamlessly across different browsers with minimal changes. Additionally, it has been designed with a **point system and critter collection** to give users a reason to stay engaged.

## 🎨 Creativity Behind Critter Break  
As animal lovers, I’ve seen the positive effect animals can have on people’s well-being. This inspired me to build a gamified break system centered around critters. By introducing new animals as rewards, users are encouraged to take regular breaks while enjoying interactions with their virtual companions.

## 👩‍💻 Development & Tools  
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Platform Tested**: Google Chrome  
Due to its larger user base, I started by testing the addon on Google Chrome, with plans to expand compatibility.
