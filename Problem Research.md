# Problem Research

## Problem Brief
As I increasingly rely on technological devices for both work and play, I’ve noticed that I often neglect to take breaks from looking at screens. This habit may lead to various health issues, including poorer eyesight, headaches, sleep deprivation, and other chronic health risks from the long-term lack of physical activity.

## Backstory
I, along with my peers, spend large portions of the day using various technological devices, whether for work (e.g. coding on a laptop) or leisure (e.g. playing mobile games). The issue becomes even more pronounced when assignment deadlines are approaching. I, like many of my peers, often struggle to take breaks because 1. there's just so much to do on my devices, and 2. it's difficult to find a good moment to stop and rest.

### Prevalence
### Consequences
- [Exposure to screens](https://www.activesgcircle.gov.sg/activehealth/read/screen-time/what-are-the-negative-side-effects-of-too-much-screen-time): Eye strain, sleep deprivation, loss of cognitive ability, etc.
- [Sedentary lifestyle](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zxqd2p3/revision/2): Obesity, increased stress, increased risk of chronic health diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular problems, etc.

### Existing Solutions
Many browser extensions offer timers and reminders based on concepts like the Pomodoro method for taking breaks. However, these solutions are often easily skippable, and they don’t provide extrinsic motivation for me to actually take breaks, so there’s no real reason to follow the timer unless I personally want to.
