# Solution Identification
## Technical Aspect
In order to solve the problem, we decided that the final result would have to be something **easily accessible** on one's computer. This gave us two ideas:
- A browser addon
- An application built with .NET
  
Both of these would be easily installable for the user, so that our solution can address the user most directly during their screentime, as opposed to using an external reminder system, which the user can ignore or skip more easily.

Ultimately, we decided to go with the former, as a browser addon would have made for a **cross-platform** solution as it can be accepted on multiple browsers with minimal changes, regardless of the underlying OS. Furthermore, browser addons would allow us to make use of **APIs** such as storage, to faciliate the running of our addon.
## Creative Aspect
Furthermore, in order to prevent the problem that existing solutions have, that being the lack of motivation, we knew that we wanted to utilize the idea of gamification to provide users with the extrinsic motivation to take breaks. As both of us are animal lovers, and have personally seen the success of incorporating animals to boost engagement in other projects, we eventually settled on making a system inspired by critters.
